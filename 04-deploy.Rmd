# Deploying your application {#deploy}

## Shinyapps.io

Sign up to <https://www.shinyapps.io/>. Your university may already have a subscription, otherwise you can use a free plan to host your app.

## Bioconductor

Before deploying, you should specific the bioconductor repository (depending on updates, a very new version may be incompatible with `Shiny` briefly). You can also check which repositories have been set using `getOption("repos")`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
setRepositories(addURLs = c(BioC = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/bioc")) #specify version here
```

And, DEPLOY! (this may take awhile). If you are using RStudio, you can also deploy using the blue icon in the top-right corner.

```{r eval=FALSE}
rsconnect::deployApp()
```
