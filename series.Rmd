# Overview

Here we will describe how to build a Shiny app for sequencing data using the code base described in _CITE PAPER HERE_.

A working example of this app is hosted at <https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/> and the code base is provided at <https://github.com/aliibarry/omics-database>.

A previous version of <https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/> was first published in Barry _et al._ 2023 but was updated here to reflect a more developer-friendly code base along with addition features (eg. network integration). 

## Shiny

If you are completely new to Shiny, we recommend working through some short tutorials first, just to wrap your head around the structure <https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/>.


<!-- Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. -->

<!-- Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`. -->

<!-- The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. -->

<!-- ## Render book -->

<!-- You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: -->

<!-- 1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and -->

<!-- 1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. -->

<!-- Or build the book from the R console: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- bookdown::render_book() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>. -->

<!-- ## Preview book -->

<!-- As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console: -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- bookdown::serve_book() -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ```{r include=FALSE} -->
<!-- # automatically create a bib database for R packages -->
<!-- knitr::write_bib(c( -->
<!--   .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown' -->
<!-- ), 'packages.bib') -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Data Processing {#data}

## Preparation

To implement this app, you will need three types of data:

1. Count tables in “./data/CountTables/” folder

```{r}

# ADD CODE HERE

```

2. Column Data (abbrev: colData) in “./data/ColDatas/” folder
  * This contains the info about each sample
  * The colnames of colData should include ‘Population’, ‘Timepoint’, ‘Sex’ , ‘Dataset’ and ‘Species’
  * If your experiment does not separate those samples based on any of those parameters, you will need to create a column that specifies this. E.g. if your samples are of mixed sex, you can creates a ‘Sex’ column containing ‘mixed’ for all samples.
3. Differential Expression data frames (abbrev: deg_df) in “./data/DegData/” folder
  * This data file contains the log2FoldChange and statistics of one experimental group compared to the control
  * An experiment can have multiple deg_df files

# User Interface {#ui}





<!-- ## Cross-references {#cross} -->

<!-- Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. -->

<!-- ## Chapters and sub-chapters -->

<!-- There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: -->

<!-- 1. Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`.  -->
<!--     - Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`. -->
<!--     - To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`. -->

<!-- 1. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using `\@ref(nice-label)`; for example, please see Chapter \@ref(cross).  -->
<!--     - If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here](#cross). -->

<!-- ## Captioned figures and tables -->

<!-- Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively. -->

<!-- See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). -->

<!-- ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). -->

<!-- ```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', -->
<!--   booktabs = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Troubleshooting {#trouble}

## Package installation

Most packages are installed from CRAN using `install.packages` or bioconductor using `BiocManager::install()`. Make sure to also install dependencies, and check to see which functions are masked by other packages if you change the order of loading libraries. 

Some require installation from github, using `devtools`. For example, `dict` installation:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mkuhn/dict")
```

If you are using Windows and struggling with compilation, make sure `RTools` is installed properly (<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html>). If you don't have write permissions to update packages, this may require administrator access.

## File setup

The most common error is that your file names or `PATH` is incorrect.  

## Styling

If you are using a style sheet (`style.css`), first make sure it's in the correct repository. Are default options from`Shiny` overriding the options in your style sheet? Check options for each function. For more help, see
<https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html>. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# example fluidRow
tabItem(tabName = tabName,
        fluidRow(box(title = datasetTitle,
                     status = "primary", # these with affect styling
                     solidHeader = TRUE, # these with affect styling
                     if (is.null(des_dir) == FALSE) {includeHTML(des_dir)},
                     if (is.null(image_dir) == FALSE) {img(src = image_dir, height = 150, width = 400)}
        )),br(),
        actionLink(NS(id, "link_to_home"), "Home", icon = icon("home")),br(),br(),
        actionButton(NS(id, "load"), "Plot Graphs")
)
```

## Deployment

Simple apps can be directly deployed with `rsconnect::deployApp()`, but it is common to have issues with the first deployment *even when the app works locally*. Here are a few examples below, but your error code will help inform a starting point (in particular, is there one package highlighted as a potential issue?)

### Basics

1. Slow deployment: Uploading bundle for application and building packages will take time. Are you loading unneccessary data or packages? 
2. Memory: check `Instance Size` on shinyapps.io, this can be increased with specific pricing packages.

### Bioconductor

Because this framework uses Biocondutor packages, it is likely you need to set the repository (URL). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# example error 1: you need to set a URL

May be unable to deploy package dependency 'AnnotationDbi'; could not
determine a repository URL for the source 'Bioconductor'.

# example error 2: the URL is set but not sufficient to compile packages, may need to try another Bioconductor version, update packages, fix compiling, turn off a firewall, or update R

Unhandled Exception: Child Task 873781155 failed: Error parsing manifest: 
Unable to determine package source for Bioconductor package
```

You can specific the bioconductor repository here (depending on updates, a very new version may be incompatible with `Shiny` briefly). You can check which repositories have been set using `getOption("repos")`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
setRepositories(addURLs = c(BioC = "https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/bioc")) #specify version here

# alternatively, this can be run at the top of the UI and *may* help
library(BiocManager)
options(repos = BiocManager::repositories())
```

If there is a specific package referred to, check the installation to make sure it was successful (see above). You can force a new install using `force = TRUE`, but restart R before trying again. 

If you are planning to update many packages, you can check which are valid first. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::valid() 
```

Still not working? A few other things to look for:

1. Package dependency mismatch between CRAN and Bioconductor (check `rsconnect::appDependencies()`)
2. Make sure you are using a released version of R (shinyapps.io doesn't support beta versions, and you may need to revert to a released version of R and update packages.)
3. Your local firewall/antivirus may be blocking deployment. 

If all else fails, try posting on the community forum for help (<https://community.rstudio.com/) and tag _Shiny_ and _shinyapp.io_ with a reproducible example (ie. _reprex_). See <https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-tips-for-writing-r-related-questions/6824> for how to best format this. 

For reference, the following were used for our database.
```{r}
rsconnect::appDependencies()
getOption("repos")
sessionInfo()
```

Happy building!
