A working example of this app is hosted at https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/ and the code base is provided at https://github.com/aliibarry/omics-database. A previous version of https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/ was first published in Barry et al. 2023 but was updated here to reflect a more developer-friendly code base along with addition features (eg. network integration). 1.1 Shiny If you are completely new to Shiny, we recommend working through some short tutorials first, just to wrap your head around the structure https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/. "],["data.html", "Chapter 2 Data Processing 2.1 Preparation 2.2 Building an SQL database", " Chapter 2 Data Processing 2.1 Preparation To implement this app, you will need three types of data: Count tables in ./data/CountTables/ folder # ADD CODE HERE Column Data (abbrev: colData) in ./data/ColDatas/ folder This contains the info about each sample The colnames of colData should include Population, Timepoint, Sex , Dataset and Species If your experiment does not separate those samples based on any of those parameters, you will need to create a column that specifies this. E.g. if your samples are of mixed sex, you can creates a Sex column containing mixed for all samples. Differential Expression data frames (abbrev: deg_df) in ./data/DegData/ folder This data file contains the log2FoldChange and statistics of one experimental group compared to the control An experiment can have multiple deg_df files 2.2 Building an SQL database "],["ui.html", "Chapter 3 User Interface", " Chapter 3 User Interface "],["server.html", "Chapter 4 Server", " Chapter 4 Server "],["deploy.html", "Chapter 5 Deploying your application 5.1 Shinyapps.io 5.2 Bioconductor", " Chapter 5 Deploying your application 5.1 Shinyapps.io Sign up to https://www.shinyapps.io/. Your university may already have a subscription, otherwise you can use a free plan to host your app. 5.2 Bioconductor Before deploying, you should specific the bioconductor repository (depending on updates, a very new version may be incompatible with Shiny briefly). You can also check which repositories have been set using getOption(\"repos\"). setRepositories(addURLs = c(BioC = &quot;https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/bioc&quot;)) #specify version here And, DEPLOY! (this may take awhile). If you are using RStudio, you can also deploy using the blue icon in the top-right corner. rsconnect::deployApp() Still not working? Check our troubleshooting guide (6) for more help. It may be as simple as turning off your firewall. "],["trouble.html", "Chapter 6 Troubleshooting 6.1 Package installation 6.2 File setup 6.3 Styling 6.4 Deployment", " Chapter 6 Troubleshooting 6.1 Package installation Most packages are installed from CRAN using install.packages or bioconductor using BiocManager::install(). Make sure to also install dependencies, and check to see which functions are masked by other packages if you change the order of loading libraries. Some require installation from github, using devtools. For example, dict installation: if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;mkuhn/dict&quot;) If you are using Windows and struggling with compilation, make sure RTools is installed properly (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html). If you dont have write permissions to update packages, this may require administrator access. 6.2 File setup The most common error is that your file names or PATH is incorrect. 6.3 Styling If you are using a style sheet (style.css), first make sure its in the correct repository. Are default options fromShiny overriding the options in your style sheet? Check options for each function. For more help, see https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html. # example fluidRow tabItem(tabName = tabName, fluidRow(box(title = datasetTitle, status = &quot;primary&quot;, # these with affect styling solidHeader = TRUE, # these with affect styling if (is.null(des_dir) == FALSE) {includeHTML(des_dir)}, if (is.null(image_dir) == FALSE) {img(src = image_dir, height = 150, width = 400)} )),br(), actionLink(NS(id, &quot;link_to_home&quot;), &quot;Home&quot;, icon = icon(&quot;home&quot;)),br(),br(), actionButton(NS(id, &quot;load&quot;), &quot;Plot Graphs&quot;) ) 6.4 Deployment Simple apps can be directly deployed with rsconnect::deployApp(), but it is common to have issues with the first deployment even when the app works locally. Here are a few examples below, but your error code will help inform a starting point (in particular, is there one package highlighted as a potential issue?) 6.4.1 Basics Slow deployment: Uploading bundle for application and building packages will take time. Are you loading unneccessary data or packages? Memory: check Instance Size on shinyapps.io, this can be increased with specific pricing packages. 6.4.2 Bioconductor Because this framework uses Biocondutor packages, it is likely you need to set the repository (URL). # example error 1: you need to set a URL May be unable to deploy package dependency &#39;AnnotationDbi&#39;; could not determine a repository URL for the source &#39;Bioconductor&#39;. # example error 2: the URL is set but not sufficient to compile packages, may need to try another Bioconductor version, update packages, fix compiling, turn off a firewall, or update R Unhandled Exception: Child Task 873781155 failed: Error parsing manifest: Unable to determine package source for Bioconductor package You can specific the bioconductor repository here (depending on updates, a very new version may be incompatible with Shiny briefly). You can check which repositories have been set using getOption(\"repos\"). setRepositories(addURLs = c(BioC = &quot;https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/bioc&quot;)) #specify version here # alternatively, this can be run at the top of the UI and *may* help library(BiocManager) options(repos = BiocManager::repositories()) If there is a specific package referred to, check the installation to make sure it was successful (see above). You can force a new install using force = TRUE, but restart R before trying again. If you are planning to update many packages, you can check which are valid first. BiocManager::valid() Still not working? A few other things to look for: Package dependency mismatch between CRAN and Bioconductor (check rsconnect::appDependencies()) Make sure you are using a released version of R (shinyapps.io doesnt support beta versions, and you may need to revert to a released version of R and update packages.) Your local firewall/antivirus may be blocking deployment. If all else fails, try posting on the community forum for help (&lt;https://community.rstudio.com/) and tag Shiny and shinyapp.io with a reproducible example (ie. reprex). See https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-tips-for-writing-r-related-questions/6824 for how to best format this.
